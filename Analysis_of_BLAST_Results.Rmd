# Introduction

The human skin contains a large amount of bacteria on its surface due to its constant contact with air and different objects in daily life. Those bacterial communities are able to survive on skin surface for long periods of time because most of them are highly resistant to environmental stress factors like temperature and UV, thus, skin surface is a favorable habitat for them. 

According to the recent studies, it is found out that the diversity of bacterial communities on palm surface is much higher than what is previously assumed and that after washing hands, the  surviving bacteria are able to reproduce rapidly and recover their previous population. It is also found out that the genera of bacteria living on the palm surface largely varies between individuals.

In the light of these information, we hypothesize that the specificity of the bacterial community genera in male and female palm surfaces can be used for forensic investigation in terms of gender identification by comparing the bacteria found on different objects with those found on the palm surfaces of individuals. In order to test our hypothesis, we made several plots using the study of Fierer et al. in which bacterial communities from keyboards and computer mouses were extracted along with those from the palm surfaces of individuals using those equipment, then the genera of the bacteria from keyboards and computer mouses were compared with those from skin surfaces using pyrosequencing. The first figure will demonstrate the most abundant taxa in male vs female hands to see the level of similaries and differences between bacterial community genera in male and female palm surfaces, the second and figures will demonstrate 
# Methods

## Sample origin and sequencing

For the computer mouse analysis, the palm surfaces of 5 men and 4 women from University of Colorado campus were swabbed along with the computer mouses of each individual's personal computer which were last touched by their owners 12 hours before the swabbing. All swabs were stored in -80Â°C until the DNA extraction. Then, the database of bacterial communities from both the right and left hand palm surfaces of 270 other individuals were compiled, sampled and analyzed.

For the pyrosequencing, DNA was extracted from samples by using MO BIO Powersoil DNA isolation kit. Amplicons were cleaned using the UltraClean-htp 96-well PCR Clean-up kit and the DNA concentration inside the amplicon were measured using the Quant-iT PicoGreen dsDNA reagent and kit. 

## Computational

On a tmux session, QC reports were created using the data from NCBI using FastQC program. Then, we used the Cyberduck program to transfer the files from tmux to our computer. After then, we trimed the sequences by looking at their quality scores, that is, any sequence below 150 base pairs were filtered. Furthermore, we  Blasted the sequences to obtain the top match of each sequence.Finally, we used dplyr functions to visualize our data on Rstudio by making plots.

In this figure, we can see that the number of most abundant taxa in male and female hands which are higher than 100.

# Discussion

We found out that Solemya pervemicosa gill symbiont is the most abundant bacteria in males and Bartonella washoensis is the most abundant bacteria in females. We're wondering why this is the case but it is hard to find an answer since the information about those bacteria are very limited for now. As far as we know, Solemya pervemicosa gill symbionts are chemosynthetic bacteria, that is, they convert CH4 or CO2 into organic compounds and they provide their host with necessary nutrients. We can argue that these symbionts were somehow transferred from Solemya pervemicosa clams to humans and they had a very favorable habitat in palm surface, specifically male palm surfaces since none of them were found in female palm surfaces. One possibility is that a male individual made contact with the gills of a Solemya pervemicosa and then he made its way to the men's restroom in university campus and from here, it has spread to the hands of the male individuals from siphon and faucet surfaces. Further experimentation and research is needed to answer how did they transfer to humans and why they are only seen in males in a very high amount.

When it comes to Bartonella washoensis, we have to urge upon a detail, that is, Bartonella washoensis is pathogenic for humans as it causes meningitis. Somehow, this pathogenic bacteria didn't make its way into the body and cause disease because we know that all the female individuals participated in this experiment are healthy. One possibility is that they are all immunized by meningococcal vaccine. Another interesting detail in our results is that this bacteria is only found in female palm surfaces. We know that this bacteria is transmitted to humans by ground squirrels, so we can argue that one of the female individuals made contact with a ground squirrel that possesses the bacteria and then, just like the previous case, she made her way to the women's restroom in university campus and caused the spread of the bacteria among females. Once again, further experimentation and research is needed to answer why those female individuals didn't have meningitis and why they are only seen in females in a very high concentration.

If we can find out the answers of those questions and detect other bacteria that are gender-specific, it'll be useful in forensic investigations because we can find out if the suspect is a male or female by analying the bacteria genera and determining the gender-specific ones.
